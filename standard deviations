# Bootstrap analysis to estimate if the Standard Deviations of two data series statistically differ or not

# Read data:

df <- read.csv2("C:/Users/Utente/Desktop/assay.csv")
data1 <- df$assay_1
data2 <- df$assay_2

#set up the bootstrap

B <- 500 #number of replicates
n <- nrow(df) #sample size
R <- numeric(B) #storage for replicates


# bootstrap estimate the ratio of standard deviations of the two data series data1 and data2
set.seed(1) # to get reproducible results

  #randomly select the indices
  i <- sample(1:n, size = n, replace = TRUE)
  data1_resampled <- df$assay_1[i] #i is a vector of indices
  data2_resampled <- df$assay_2[i]
  a1 <- sd(data1_resampled)
  a2 <- sd(data2_resampled)
  R[b] <- (a1/a2)
